# api-social-auth

WIP!!!!!

- Express as web server
- [email-verification](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-verification) for sending validation email to new local user accountds
- Passport for local and social login (facebook, google, twitter)
- Local auth using JWT

- It will be connected to a react-redux app (I'll use another repo for the example).
